# Arch Network Examples

Welcome to the Arch Network Examples repository! This collection of examples demonstrates various features and capabilities of the Arch Network platform, with a focus on eBPF and networking applications.

## Overview

This repository contains practical examples and demonstrations to help you understand and implement Arch Network features. Each example is self-contained and includes detailed documentation to get you started.

## Examples

### eBPF Counter
A basic example demonstrating eBPF program implementation for packet counting in Arch Network.

- Location: `/examples/ebpf-counter`
- Features:
  - Basic eBPF program structure
  - Packet counting implementation
  - Integration with Arch Network
  - Tracing and logging functionality

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (latest stable version)
- Linux kernel 5.15 or later (for eBPF support)
- Cargo and rustc installed
