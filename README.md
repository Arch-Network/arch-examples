# Arch Network Examples

Welcome to the Arch Network Examples repository! This collection of examples demonstrates various features and capabilities of the Arch Network platform, with a focus on eBPF and networking applications.

## Overview

This repository contains practical examples and demonstrations to help you understand and implement Arch Network features. Each example is self-contained and includes detailed documentation to get you started.

## Examples

### eBPF Counter
A basic example demonstrating eBPF program implementation for packet counting in Arch Network.

- Location: `/examples/ebpf-counter`
- Features:
  - Basic eBPF program structure
  - Packet counting implementation
  - Integration with Arch Network
  - Tracing and logging functionality
  - Performance metrics visualization
  - Real-time packet analysis

### Hello World
A simple starter example to understand the basics of Arch Network programming.

- Location: `/examples/helloworld`
- Features:
  - Basic program structure and deployment
  - Account management and transactions
  - Message signing and verification
  - State management examples
  - Integration with Bitcoin transactions
  - Cross-program invocation examples

### Oracle
A demonstration of how to implement an oracle service on Arch Network.

- Location: `/examples/oracle`
- Features:
  - External data fetching and validation
  - Secure data transmission
  - State updates based on external triggers
  - Multi-signature verification
  - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
  - Real-time data feed implementation

### Fungible Token Standard
An implementation of a fungible token standard for Arch Network.

- Location: `/examples/fungible-token-standard`
- Features:
  - Token creation and management
  - Transfer functionality
  - Balance tracking
  - Account authorization
  - Standard token interface implementation
  - Integration with Bitcoin's UTXO model

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (latest stable version)
- Linux kernel 5.15 or later (for eBPF support)
- Cargo and rustc installed

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arch-network/examples.git
   cd examples
   ```

2. Choose an example directory:
   ```bash
   cd examples/ebpf-counter/program
   ```

3. Build and it is ready to be deployed:
   ```bash
   cargo-build-sbf
   ```

## Project Structure

Each example follows a consistent structure:

```bash
example-name/
├─ Cargo.toml # Dependencies and project configuration
├─ program/ # Source code
├─ README.md # Example-specific documentation
├─ src/ # Test files
```
